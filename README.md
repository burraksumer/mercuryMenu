## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burraksumer/mercuryMenu/main/static/websiteScreenshot.png)

Introducing the Mercury Online Menu, a web application I created for a café of a friend of mine that serves exceptional coffee, cocktails, foods, teas, and more. Built with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS, this sleek and visually appealing frontend provides a seamless user experience. Powered by Pocketbase for the backend and deployed on Netlify's edge, the menu is always up-to-date and served with speed and reliability. Explore the Mercury Online Menu and discover the café's mouthwatering offerings. Cheers to good taste and great technology!
